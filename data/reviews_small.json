I ordered the carne asada plate and the rest of our table ordered. That is about where the great service stopped. A couple other people came after and it seemed that her service went to the other 2 tables as they got their food before us even after being seated well after us and they had their bill paid and left well before we could even get her attention for the bill. After getting the bill we had to sit around even more waiting for her to get it and return our card. This is the loss of the 2 stars as poor service can ruin an experience\n\nThe food was pretty good though. My carne asada was very moist and very flavorful. I was able to make a burrito with it as they serviced it with chorizo beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream and a tortilla. They also served some potatoes with it but they were meh at the best. Still had extra carne asada which was very nice as I was able to eat it alone and it was good. The chips and salsa was good and they had this tomatillo salsa that was great\n\nOverall, I'd probably return but not if I was in a hurry or had to meet people somewhere","date":"2012-05-29 04:07:14"}

Ultimately a hotel is a place to sleep and this one was pretty good at that. And it was a reasonable price for being downtown.

The little home sized air conditioning unit doesn't quite do the trick. \n - our shower plugged up and wouldn't drain on first use.

At 2pm the next day someone came to look at our shower. Good thing I'd found the plunger labeled 'for shower\/sink only' and fixed it myself because we had to be at a wedding by 3. \n - the morning of our checkout a woman knocked on our door at 9:30 to ask when we'd be ready to checkout.

Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show \"you are here\" backwards from where you really are). At one point my wife and I were tempted to just eat any place, but it became a game to find this restaurant. Once here it was smaller than expected and kind of exposed to the mall. But we were happy to find it! \n\nThe service was superb! Wish I remembered our waiters name. A younger Italian gentleman. Super nice, checked on us at all the right times. Overall very good service. \n\nFood: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food. \n\nOur bill came and it was \"cheap\" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks.

I remember seeing this place open up near my apartment. Didn't look like much but me being the way I am insisted on trying it. Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!\n\nWhen I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.\n\nAs for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.\n\nIf there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song. \n\nAll in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.\n\nSpeaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.\n\nAlso, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!\n\nIf your ever up in the Downsview area be sure to hit this place up. Would recommend over any Wasabi and maybe even over the Mandarine with Oishi Sushi introduction of Crab Legs to their dinner buffet!","date":"2009-05-21 16:20:42"}

The whole experience was a nightmare. We departed the airport and found their booth outside and waited in line only to find out since we had a voucher we did not need a ticket. It did not state anywhere on there about that.\n\nNext we went over to stand in line and wait for the shuttle with the other 50 or so people. Shuttle took 15-20 minutes to arrive. It took another 15 minutes to load and depart and then it was another 15 minutes before another one arrived. Luckily I was able to get on that one, but what a fiasco. They have the worst service and are way too slow. They want you to call in advance to arrange your return pick up and they come and get you 2-3 hours before you need to be at the airport. F*** that. These people will never see me or any of my money again. We are taking a cab back to the airport since we are close I think it would have been cheaper just to take a cab in the first place.

The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time\n\nMy plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.\n\nWe had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.\n\nWe sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.\n\n\"What table was yours?\nThe table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.\"\n\nAt that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave\n\nShe finally came out, and I got the lowdown.\n\n- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)\n- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager\n- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.","date":"2012-04-28 16:02:06"}
